@article{Repenning2015,
abstract = {An educated citizenry that participates in and contributes to science technology engineering and mathematics innovation in the 21st century will require broad literacy and skills in computer science (CS). School systems will need to give increased attention to opportunities for students to engage in computational thinking and ways to promote a deeper understanding of how technologies and software are used as design tools. However, K-12 students in the United States are facing a broken pipeline for CS education. In response to this problem, we have developed the Scalable Game Design curriculum based on a strategy to integrate CS education into the regular school curriculum. This strategy includes opportunities for students to design and program games and science technology engineering and mathematics simulations. An approach called Computational Thinking Pattern Analysis has been developed to measure and correlate computational thinking skills relevant to game design and simulations. Results from a study with more than 10,000 students demonstrate rapid adoption of this curriculum by teachers from multiple disciplines, high student motivation, high levels of participation by women, and interest regardless of demographic background.},

abstract = {In this article, I examine the phenomenon of casual games and the underlying transformation of digital play which the rise of this particular segment of the games industry is exposing. I argue that instead of a genuinely new phenomenon, we are facing a change that can be more accurately characterized as "the normalization of digital play". The expansion of the player basis as well as the instrumental and functional approaches to games concurs with the transformations of other digital environments. As digital environments have become more accessible to large populations and are increasingly part of everyday lives, the ways and means of using them are becoming multifaceted and part of wider experiences. In order to respond to the changes, I propose a framework of casual games design values. Transformation in the games cultures requires transformation in design approaches. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

abstract = {This report describes a case study of small-scale effort in employing game playtesting as a starting point for learning about mainstream issues and challenges found in modern software engineering projects and practices. The goal is to be descriptive and informing through a qualitative rendering, rather than prescriptive and quantitative analysis. This study draws attention to the case of where a student with no prior experience in software development or programming must take on the task of learning how to make a game, and along the way learn about many common challenges in modern SE practice through personal discovery and experience. The game itself also imposes challenges in that we have chosen a new, unfamiliar game genre and domain that emphasizes science learning as its purpose for play. Along the way, we discuss issues in requirements, design, prototyping, testing, user experience assessment, and evolutionary software extension, all prior to a formal education in coding or introductory level Computer Science or SE. Though our efforts may seem unusual or anomalous, we believe our methods are open for adoption and reuse by those interested in lowering the barriers to entry into game software development in specific, and into SE more generally.},

@article{Ryoo2013,
abstract = {Despite the fact that computer science (CS) is the driver of technological innovations across all disciplines and aspects of our lives, including participatory media, high school CS too commonly fails to incorporate the perspectives and concerns of low-income students of color. This article describes a partnership program - Exploring Computer Science (ECS) - that directly counters this problem in our nation's second largest school district. With a mission of democratizing CS learning, we argue that despite the constraints of working within public schools, it is imperative to do so. We discuss the ECS program based on inquiry, culturally relevant curriculum, and equity-oriented pedagogy. We describe two ECS-affiliated projects that highlight the importance of authorship, purpose, and agency for student learning and engagement: DietSens using mobile technology to study community health, and a project in which students create video games about social issues. Our work offers a counter-narrative to those who have written off the possibilities of working within public schools and a debunking of the too widespread myth within our educational system that females and students of color are inherently uninterested in rigorous CS learning. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

People in the MDGD community have proposed several approaches in the past decades, addressing both the technology and the development process in the context of MDGD. This article presents the state-of-art of MDGD research based on a literature review of 26 approaches in the field. The review is structured around five perspectives: target game domains, domain frameworks, modelling languages, tooling, and evaluation methods.

@article{Deterding2011,
abstract = {Recent years have seen a rapid proliferation of mass-market consumer software that takes inspiration from video games. Usually summarized as "gamification", this trend connects to a sizeable body of existing concepts and research in human-computer interaction and game studies, such as serious games, pervasive games, alternate reality games, or playful design. However, it is not clear how "gamification" relates to these, whether it denotes a novel phenomenon, and how to define it. Thus, in this paper we investigate "gamification" and the historical origins of the term in relation to precursors and similar concepts. It is suggested that "gamified" applications provide insight into novel, gameful phenomena complementary to playful phenomena. Based on our research, we propose a definition of "gamification" as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

The development of such software is a significant challenge in user interface design, requiring a new design approach compared to the design of more traditional creative tools, and with much scope for mixed-initiative co-creation and other assistive AI technologies. Our aim with fluidic games is to democratise game design, allowing anyone and everyone to express themselves through the artform of digital games.},

abstract = {The democratisation of design permits greater stakeholder involvement in what has traditionally been a domain reserved for experts; the design process itself. This is enabled by technological advances in fields such as 3D printing, virtual reality and high-speed peer to peer communication technologies which have fuelled the development of new and innovative design methods. This paper compares and contrasts different approaches to the democratisation of design, and in particular, those that aim to involve wider stakeholders in the design process itself. Three different approaches(design by play, design by generation and crowdsourcing for design) are defined and contextualised within existing design frameworks and their respective suitabilities to democratise different design phases are considered. An exemplar use case of each approach is presented in order to assess how stakeholder engagement is affected by each democratising strategy. The discussion compares and contrasts the approaches with respect to their applicability and utility for different stages of the design process and how the power dynamics of the design process are altered when the different approaches are employed.},

abstract = {I first heard the term “gameplay” when I interviewed for a job at Atari in 1982. It was used by someone who had just played a new arcade game, Zaxxon, I think. “It has good gameplay.” Since then, the term has become ubiquitous in the fi eld. People talk about gameplay, as if it's some magical, mystical thing that games need to possess. Game designers like to paint themselves as “someone who understand gameplay,” unlike all you coders and management types and artists. But actually, few do – because “gameplay” itself is a nebulous, and therefore pretty useless term. Saying “it has good gameplay” is about as useful as saying “that's a good book.” Calling something “good” doesn't help us understand what's good about it, what pleasures it provides, and how to go about doing something else good.},
